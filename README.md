1. [Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.](https://github.com/souvikhaldar/Famous-algorithmic-problems-/blob/master/first.py)

2. [You are given two linked-lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.](https://github.com/souvikhaldar/Famous-algorithmic-problems-/blob/master/sumLL.py)  

3. [Given `n` people in a circle, `kth` person is killed in every iteration. Find the survivor. (Josephus Problem)](https://github.com/souvikhaldar/Data-structures-in-Python/blob/master/miscellaneous/recursion/josephus.py)

5. [Given a rope of length `n`, you need to find maximum number of pieces you can make such that length of every piece is in set {a,b,c} for given three values a,b and c.](https://github.com/souvikhaldar/Data-structures-in-Python/blob/04e03321d62b1837ecc5970df402c47c4ff14e8e/miscellaneous/recursion/rope.py)
